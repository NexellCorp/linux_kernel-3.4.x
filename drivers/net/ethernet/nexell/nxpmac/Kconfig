	  This selects the platform specific bus support for
	  the nxpmac device driver. This is the driver used
	  on many embedded STM platforms based on ARM and SuperH
	  processors.
	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
